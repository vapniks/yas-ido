* Commands

Below are complete command list:

 - `yas-ido-expand-snippet' : Select snippet using ido and expand it. 
 - `yas-ido-edit-snippet' : Select snippet using ido and edit it.


* Installation

Put yas-ido.el in a directory in your load-path, e.g. ~/.emacs.d/
You can add a directory to your load-path with the following line in ~/.emacs
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "~/elisp"))
where ~/elisp is the directory you want to add 
(you don't need to do this for ~/.emacs.d - it's added by default).

Add the following to your ~/.emacs startup file.

(require 'yas-ido)
